# Recipe entry test project for Software Engineering Internship at Code94 Labs  

**database used :** MongoDB Atlas  

**packages used :** react , express , material ui , axios , react-router-dom , cors , mongoose , nodemon  

I've also deployed this web app on the following URL so you can give it a try:  
https://recipe-app-entry-test.vercel.app 

URL for the backend API of that deployment:  
https://recipe-app-entry-test.onrender.com  

GitHub Repo of the deployed project:  
https://github.com/avishkaindula/deployed-recipe-project-entry-test  
(The repo above is exactly the same recipe-entry-test project. But I've changed the urls of the backend from localhost:5000 to recipe-app-entry-test.onrender.com on that repo.)  

**Starting Guide**  

=> download and install node.js on the computer  
=> open up the terminal  
=> cd backend  
=> npm install  
=> npm start  
=> This will start the backend server  
=> keep it running

=> open up a new terminal  
=> cd frontend  
=> npm install  
=> npm start  
=> This will start the frontend server  

=> open up the web browser  
=> type the following address on the address bar  
=> localhost:3000  
=> this will now open the project
